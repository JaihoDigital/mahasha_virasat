            <h3>Linguistic Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
               The Mahasha language has its own distinct characteristics, differing from the more widely spoken languages of the region.
                It has unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation patterns that reflect the community's history and social interactions.

            <h3>Current Status and Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Today, the Mahasha language is endangered.  Due to various socio-economic factors and historical influences,
                 there has been a decline in the number of speakers, particularly among younger generations.
                 This poses a significant threat to the survival of this important aspect of our cultural heritage.
